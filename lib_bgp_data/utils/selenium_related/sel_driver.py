"""This module contains an abstraction of a Selenium Chrome webdriver.

The purpose of this class is to simplify the use of
chromedriver by abstracting the various functions
and initialization into an easy-to-use class/ context manager.
chromedriver must be found at the path, driver_path class
variable, within the SeleniumDriver class.

Design Choices (summarizing from above):
    -Allow the class to be initialized as a context manager
        -This is done to automatically handle closing chromedriver instance

Possible Future Extensions:
    -Add test cases
