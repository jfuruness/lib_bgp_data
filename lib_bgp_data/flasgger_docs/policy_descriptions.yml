          "long_desc": "Route Hijacks tend to be short lived, so long-standing announcements with an invalid ROA are more likely to be valid routes with improperly configured RPKI than actual attacks. This policy will, for example, output “Whitelist” if a year-old announcement has an invalid ROA and the parameter for “Whitelist” is 10 months."
