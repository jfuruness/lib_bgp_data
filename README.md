# lib\_bgp\_data
This package parses bgp data and inserts the raw data into a database. The data is parsed from bgpstream.com, http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-relationships/, and from the BGP Stream using https://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/api/pybgpstream/_pybgpstream.html. The entirety of this data can be inserted into the database upon processing.

## Description
There are two main classes in the package, Parser and Database. The parser parses information while the database is used to insert/update/select information.
### Parser
* Logging:
    * The parser has logging functionality, See logging description for an explanation of logging
    * The default logging is as follow:
        * Log to /var/log/bgp/parser.log
        * Log level of the file is set to logging.ERROR
        * Log level for printing is set to logging.INFO
* Different parsers:
    * The parser class can run three different processors, detailed below:
    * bgpstream.com data:
        * The class for this parser is BGPStream\_Website\_Parser
        * This class pulls html from bgpstream.com and parses it based on three kinds of events:
            * Possible Hijack (stored in database table hijack)
            * BGP Leak (stored in database table leak)
            * Outage (stored in database table outage)
        * If the entry does not already exist in the database, the information is inserted
        * If the entry does exist, then that entry is updated
        * See database schema for the specific information that is processed
    * Caida as relationship data:
        * The class for this parser is Caida\_AS\_Relationships_Parser
        * First the parser downloads files from http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-relationships/ into a default directory of /tmp/bgp
        * Then the parser unzips all the files
        * Then the parser parses the information based on the file format
            * There are three kinds of file formats:
                * The 'serial-1' as-rel files contain p2p and p2c relationships. 
                    * The format is:
                        * \<provider-as\>|\<customer-as\>|-1
                        * \<peer-as\>|\<peer-as\>|0
                * The 'serial-2' as-rel files add the source of the inference
                    * The Format is:
                        * \<provider-as\>|\<customer-as\>|-1|\<source\>
                        * \<peer-as\>|\<peer-as\>|0|\<source\>
                * The 'serial-1' ppdc-ases files contain the provider-peer customer cones
inferred for each AS.  
                    * Each line specifies an AS and all ASes we infer
to be reachable following a customer link.  
                    * The format is:
                        * \<cone-as\> \<customer-1-as\> \<customer-2-as\> .. \<customer-N-as\>
        * Then the parser adds the information to the database if it doesn't exist
        * Then the parser deletes all the files (unless otherwise specified)
    * BGP Stream data:
        * This gets BGP Stream data using the api described here: https://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/api/pybgpstream
        * The class for this parser is BGP\_Records
        * This data is formatted in a DB\_Info class then stored in the database
        * The api first gets all records
           * If the record is valid, it gets all elements
            * If the record is invalid, stop searching
        * For the specific information stored in the database, refer to the database schema
### Database
* The database is run using postgresql
    * Once the database is set up and you have logged into where it was set up, you can send it commands by doing:
        ```sh
        $ sudo -i -u postgres
        $ psql -d bgp
        ```
    * To be able to create the database tables with postgresql on ubuntu, run these commands:
        ```sh
        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
        ```
* Since the parser takes a database as an argument when initialized, a different database other than the one described here can be used
* The database supports logging
*   The default logging is as follows:
    * Log to /var/log/bgp/parser.log
    * Log level of the file is set to logging.ERROR
    * Log level for printing is set to logging.INFO
* The Database class inherits functions from many other database classes. I know this isn't really how inheritance should work, but I wanted to split up the file into multiple files for readability
* The Database class can add information to the database, and also select information for usability in other scripts
#### Database Schema
All tables are stored in database bgp, with test tables in bgp\_test
##### customer\_providers Schema
* Note that because there are multiple different formats, some fields may be empty
    * The 'serial-1' as-rel files contain p2p and p2c relationships. 
        * The format is:
            * \<provider-as\>|\<customer-as\>|-1
            * \<peer-as\>|\<peer-as\>|0
    * The 'serial-2' as-rel files add the source of the inference
        * The Format is:
            * \<provider-as\>|\<customer-as\>|-1|\<source\>
            * \<peer-as\>|\<peer-as\>|0|\<source\>
    * The 'serial-1' ppdc-ases files contain the provider-peer customer cones
inferred for each AS.  
        * Each line specifies an AS and all ASes we infer
to be reachable following a customer link.  
        * The format is:
            * \<cone-as\> \<customer-1-as\> \<customer-2-as\> .. \<customer-N-as\>

### Logging Description
* Quick Explanation of logging below:
    * There are five logging levels:
        * (highest) logging.CRITICAL *Serious error, program cannot continue to run*
        * logging.ERROR *Serious problem, software cannot complete a task*
        * logging.WARNING *Something unexpected has happened, but software is still working*
        * logging.INFO *Confirms that things are working as expected*
        * (lowest) logging.DEBUG *Detailed info, only of interest when diagnosing problems*
    * When a logging level is set, it will log everything at that log level and higher
        * For example, if logging is set to logging.ERROR, it will only log logging.ERROR and logging.CRITICAL

## Installation
##### Database installation
* For the database to be able to run, you must have set up the postgresql database with the credentials located in /etc/bgp/bgp.conf and the test postgresql database credentials located in /etc/bgp/bgp.conf
* For more information on how to setup postgresql databases, refer to: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-16-04
##### pybgpstream installation:
* This program requires pybgpstream to be able to parse bgpstream data
* This will have the latest information on how to install pybgpstream and its dependencies: https://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/install/pybgpstream
* This was correct as of 8/9/17:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
$ mkdir ~/src
$ cd ~/src/
$ curl -O https://research.wand.net.nz/software/wandio/wandio-1.0.4.tar.gz
$ tar zxf wandio-1.0.4.tar.gz
$ cd wandio-1.0.4/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
$ cd ~/src/
$ curl -O http://bgpstream.caida.org/bundles/caidabgpstreamwebhomepage/dists/bgpstream-1.2.1.tar.gz
$ tar zxf bgpstream-1.2.1.tar.gz
$ cd bgpstream-1.2.1/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```
##### lib\_bgp\_data installation:
Once postgresql database is set up, and pybgpstream is set up:
```sh
pip3 install lib_bgp_data
```
##### testing your installation:
Coming Soon

## Usage
### In a Script
##### Initializing the Database and Parser

> The default params for the database and parser are:   
> log\_name = "database.log"  # For Database   
> log\_name = "parser.log"  # For Parser   
> log\_file\_level = logging.ERROR  # Logging level for file   
> log\_stream\_level = logging.INFO  # Logging level for printing   
> This will cause any errors to be appended to the log file   
> This will also cause any information (and higher) to be printed.   
> See [logging description](#logging-description) for more details   

Initialize with default logging:
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
parser = Parser(database)
```
Initialize for errors only (print nothing):
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
import logging
database = Database(log_stream_level=logging.ERROR)
parser = Parser(database, log_stream_level=logging.ERROR)
```
Initialize for debugging:
> This will print all debug statements and above   
> This will also log all info statements and above   
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
import logging
database = Database(log_file_level=logging.INFO,
                    log_stream_level=logging.DEBUG
                    )
parser = Parser(database,
                log_file_level=logging.INFO,
                log_stream_level=logging.DEBUG
                )
```

#### How to Run BGPStream\_Website\_Parser
This will get data from bgpstream.com and insert it into the database
Default arguments for the bgpstream parser:
> parellel = None   
> This doesn't run in parallel even though it can, because   
> bgpstream.com cuts off the program after about 100 rows.   
> If you are doing a very small amount of rows, then you can parse in parallel for speed.   
   
> row\_limit = None   
> The row\_limit is how many rows of data from bgpstream.com to parse   
> This was mainly added for testing purposes   
   
Default argument for running the bgpstream parser:   
> max\_processes=multiprocessing.cpu\_count()   
> Note that this argument will only be used if parallel argument is not None   
> Defines the number of processes to run at any given time   
To parse data from bgpstream.com with defaults (recommended):
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
parser = Parser(database)
parser.run_bgpstream_parser()
```
To parse data from bgpstream.com in parallel for testing:
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
# Will make the bgpstream_parser run in parallel for 10 rows
bgp_stream_args = {"parallel": True, "row_limit": 10}
parser = Parser(database, bgp_stream_args=bgp_stream_args)
# Runs in parallel with 5 processes at most at any given time
parser.run_bgpstream_parser(max_processes=5)
```
#### How to Run Caida\_AS\_Relationships\_Parser
This will get data from http://data.caida.org/datasets/as-relationships/ and insert it into the database
Default arguments for the as\_relationships parser:
> path = "/tmp/bgp"   
> This is the default path for the files to be downloaded to   

Default argument for running the as\_relationships parser:
> clean\_up=True   
> If clean\_up == True, downloaded files will be deleted after parsing   
> downloaded=False   
> If downloaded == False, the directory will be deleted and the files will be downloaded again   
To parse as\_relationships data with defaults (recommended):
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
parser = Parser(database)
parser.run_as_relationship_parser()
```
To parse as\_relationships data in non default location, without deleting files, after they have already been downloaded:
```python
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
# Will make the bgpstream_parser run in parallel for 10 rows
as_relationships_args = {"path": "/tmp/not_default/"}
parser = Parser(database,  as_relationships_args=as_relationships_args)
parser.run_as_relationship_parser(downloaded=True, clean_up=False)
```
#### How to Run BGP\_Records to get BGPStream data
This will get data from BGPStream and insert it into the database   
Start and end must be entered as a datatime object   
To parse bgpstream data with start and end:
```python
from datetime import datetime
from lib_bgp_data import Database, Parser
database = Database()
